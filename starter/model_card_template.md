For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details
- **Model Type:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Framework:** Scikit-Learn
- **Hyperparameters:** Optimized via GridSearchCV
- **Inputs:** "workclass","education","marital-status","occupation","relationship","race","sex","native-country"
- **Outputs:** Predicted labels for classification tasks

## Intended Use
This is a classification model that was trained on publicly available Census Bureau data. It predicts the salary class based on the input features. The model is trained to assist in decision-making processes.

## Training Data
- The model used the Census Bureau data.
- Categorical features were one-hot encoded, and the target variable was binarized.
- Training data was split into 80% training and 20% test.

## Evaluation Data
- The test set, which consists of 20% of the original dataset, was used for evaluation.
- Categorical features were processed using the same encoding techniques as in training.
- The model was also evaluated on slices of categorical data.

## Metrics
- **Accuracy:** 82%

## Ethical Considerations
- The model may exhibit bias depending on the representation of categories in the dataset.
- Performance may vary across different demographic groups, requiring careful interpretation.
- The model should not be used in applications where fairness and interpretability are critical without further bias analysis.

## Caveats and Recommendations
- This model is data-dependent, meaning performance may degrade if applied to significantly different datasets.
- Continuous monitoring and retraining are recommended to maintain accuracy over time.
- Further investigation into feature importance and bias analysis is suggested before deployment in sensitive applications.
